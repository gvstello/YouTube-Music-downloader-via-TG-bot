This is just a Python script wich takes your YT music link via Telegram bot (insert your API key into .env) and let you voice message with your music (also can download playlist).

Make sure you have (!) Python 11.9 or below (cause this works with python-telegram-bot version 13.15 (Python 12 and above didnt support urlib etc. wich need for this library)).
